						<h3>Reflection - Education & Goals</h3>
						<p>If it were not for higher education, I would not be where I am today. My degree at Penn State University has helped me surround myself with a community of like-minded people; people who have helped me grow so much as a person and connections that will last for a life time. My degree provided me the environment I needed to become a professional in the software development field. I chose a Bachelor's of Science in Information Science and Technology immediately after I discovered the major. I've known I wanted to be a programmer since around the age of 12, but most people know this is a very broad term. I eventually narrowed it down to software development for phone applications, possibly websites and games. I recently have been diving in to Blockchain development and Artificial Intelligence, but wouldn't have discovered these topics in the way I have without my university experience. My short term goals include getting a patent on a Blockchain process I created, hopefully leading that into a business and landing a full time position in Software Engineering before I graduate. I hope to eventually have my own company through following one of my passions and have the ability to make a large difference with philanthropy.</p>

						<h3>Reflection - Projects</h3>
						<p>I am most proud of my Disaster Relief and Recovery Application (DRRA) that was created for a hackathon at Penn State. This is easily the most significant projected I've created and hope to finish soon. I've always wanted to make something with software that could make a huge difference and function for charity. DRRA has the potential for servers to be paid for with minimal funds and uses AI for measuring the impact of a disaster. Although this project was done solo, it helped me realize that I can learn about any emerging technology as long as I find a liking for it. As far as collaborative projects go, I have made 3 different functional iOS applications on a teams of 3-4 and a smart contract for the TRON blockchain on a team of 2. Working solo and on a team helped me gain skills I needed to handle my own projects and also find a medium to make projects move faster on a team. Hiring me would provide your team with an entrepreneurial minded employee who is able to solve their own problems, collaborate with any team and work with others efficiently. I hope these projects are able to properly represent my passions for software development, leadership and emerging technology.</p>

						<h3>Reflection - Internships & Experiences Abroad</h3>
						<p>My most favorite experience in this adventure so far was my time spent at Loopring in Shanghai. I spent around 2 months working as a Blockchain Software Engineering intern on a team of 2. This experience not only provided me with greater technical skills when leaving, but gave me skills in relocating for a job and working with random teammates on a complex project. This was my first time relocating by myself so far away from home (actually was my first time leaving the country) and it required me to figure out public transport on the other side of the world. This is very helpful for future situations of travel and job relocation where I must quickly adjust to new time zones and methods of transportation. Working with new people who I must get along with and work more efficiently with was also required at this position, where my teammate had come from somewhere in the southern states and also across the world. I also had to report to and work with superiors that natively spoke a different language and had a different working culture, so when we ate out or spoke to each other in the workplace, different rhetoric and body language was required than my normal and I adjusted to these new "rules".</p>

						<h3>Reflection - Collaborative Experiences</h3>
						<p>Almost every project worth sharing that I've done has been done with a collaborative team, as I believe bringing in the most amount of imagination and perspectives to any project leads to better success. The smart contract another intern and I created for Loopring required both of us to read up on a programming language and concepts neither of us had ever dealt with before. Through working together we were able to understand the new technology we had to work with and create a plan to tackle the issue we were given with no prior experience. I also have participated in 4 hackathons, with only one having myself solo on a team. I entered each hackathon with different random teammates and won top prizes 2/4 times. The time I won with a team was an app myself and 2 other developers created to solve a problem at HackPSU Fall 2018. I did design, one guy did front end development and the other handled the backend. We ended up winning 1st place for the overall design competition. I believe these collaborative experiences show my potential for working well with teams in any situation and is a good reason for hiring me.</p>
