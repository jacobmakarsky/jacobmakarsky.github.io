Jacob Makarsky's Resume Website

This is my resume website with the domain being hosted on godaddy. 

Includes HTML, CSS, JS and image files. 

All file updates were done through a Mac terminal using Git.

The project was developed using Sublime Text (I definitely recommend for a lightweight IDE). I'll continue updating it as I get more free time. I love playing around with it until I'm banging my head off the table. Why? I don't know.
